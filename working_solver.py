Key instructions:
1. When the puzzle asks for a "one-token" answer, provide exactly one word or token as your response.
2. When the puzzle asks for "uppercase" answers, make sure to use ALL CAPS.
3. Pay close attention to formatting requirements - if you get feedback hinting at formatting errors, retry once with the correct format.
4. For yes/no questions, respond with exactly "YES" or "NO" in uppercase.
5. For multiple choice questions, identify the correct option based on the puzzle logic.
6. Think step by step and analyze each puzzle carefully before responding.
7. If you're unsure about a puzzle, try to break it down into smaller parts.

Analyze the puzzle description and provide the correct answer with proper formatting."""
